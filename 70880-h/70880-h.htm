<p>In considering the unity of that great brotherhood of men who
composed the armies of the United States in the war for sustaining
the government, and perpetuating the form of it made by the
founders, we have been giving attention to every phase of the
many common conditions which formed our common experience
and bound us so firmly together, excepting those of a social and
physical character. The great and firm basis of this lifelong
comradeship is, of course, the common devotion and the common
sacrifice in the service of the country on the existence of which,
latent in peace but manifest in war, the very existence of every
government is founded. This common devotion to the service
of humanity is in the political and social world what the attraction
of cohesion and the attraction of gravitation are in the physical
world. We shared alike in that sacrifice and devotion and
were fortunate in that we were born and reached an age when
that struggle came on which allowed us to have a share in that
great action, an epoch in history. We do not envy those born
since, although we shall die sooner.</p>

<p>But I think you may properly also consider subordinate conditions
of a physical character as not unworthy of mention and
not without effect in the comradeship which binds us together.
We wore common uniform, and in those four years the fashions
did not change. Each fellow looked like every other fellow.
The resemblance went even so far as that quality of personal
appearance which depends upon the use of soap and water, not
always abundant in those years. We lived for the greater part
in the same home, the spacious, well ventilated, scantily furnished
and unroofed out-of-doors. We all had the same kind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
of bringing up and education in which “Right face,” “Left face,”
and “As you were” were familiar precepts not to be disobeyed
without reproof or punishment. We were all boys when we
went into this school, some of such a tender age that we should
now hesitate to place them in command of a suffragette platoon.
We were all boys in the same class and at the same school. We
slept in the same bed, the lap of mother earth, and dined at the
same table, also usually the lap of mother earth. There was
a stern and commendable impartiality also in the distribution
of the fare. Luxuries were unknown, excepting when, through
scarcity, necessities became a luxury, but we shared alike in
abundance and want. We could say with slight paraphrase, like
the three brothers in the song:</p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">We three brothers be</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In one good cause;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Tom puffs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Bill snuffs,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I chaws.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Of all these common conditions, that of the diet has impressed
me most. It was called rations, I conjecture, from its irrational
and unfit nature and painful uniformity.</p>

<p>Who invented the army ration of 1861 to 1865 is, fortunately
for his reputation, unknown. He was probably some distinguished
commissary, and his works lived after him for many
years. He should have a monument appropriately placed
amongst the unknown dead built of some quality of stone most
nearly approximating hardtack in quality and shape, and surmounted
by a marble block carved in imitation of a hunk of
rusty salt pork.</p>

<p>In the formative period of enlistment, when we raised companies
and enlisted men no greener than ourselves, I used to
wonder at that requirement of the army regulations which related
to the teeth of the recruit. It was explained that a good set of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
teeth were necessary for a recruit on account of the necessity of
biting the end of the paper cartridge, but for this it appeared
that only front teeth were required, though the regulations
included the whole set, and grinders could not be brought into
play in the operation of biting the cartridges. But when we
passed out of the region of the recruiting barracks, and the early
stage of soft bread, and when that wonderful creation of the
culinary art known as the army cracker appeared, this mystery
of the requirement of the teeth was fully cleared up. It then
appeared that the men were selected not for courage or endurance,
which could not be examined into, but for good grinders,
and the wonder now is that men enough to put down the rebellion
could have been found with teeth equal to the task of putting
down the army hardtack.</p>

<p>Did any comrade ever study this article in a geological way?
It was a solid, there was no doubt about that. It was not a
stratified rock. It was homogeneous and amorphous, excepting
when wormy. It did not resemble anything in the vegetable,
animal or mineral kingdom, excepting brick. It was inflexible,
inelastic, infrangible, and indigestible, suited neither to the
stomach nor bowels, and was adapted, except in shape, better as
armor.</p>

<p>Indeed, instances have been reported, though perhaps not in
the official records, where the haversack of a soldier stopped the
bullet of the enemy, and these perhaps are the only cases where
it was found that the hardtack saved life. It is well known that
the army mule would not eat it, and it is another proof of the
high intelligence of that noble animal, without whose constant
aid the rebellion never would have been put down.</p>

<p>I am aware that in making this statement, in which I seem to
attribute the suppression of the rebellion to the army mule, I am
infringing the claims subsequently made by certain officers who
have been talking ever since the war, notably that famous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
quartermaster whose stories led his infant son to inquire earnestly,
“Pa, did anybody help you put down the rebellion?”</p>

<p>We all helped, in fact, but with the volunteers the first duty
was to chew, or at least to reduce the ration to chewable condition.
Soaking in water was tried, but that was too slow. The
ration of one day needed the soaking of the day before. Do any
of the companions remember seeing it spluttering in the grease
of the frying pan?</p>

<p>But the same genius which invented the hardtack must also
have invented that other main element of the ration, rusty salt
pork, an infernal compound of animal fat, with sodium chloride,
in which the chloride predominated, a combination of the cheapest
of minerals with the basest of animals, and rusted by time and
heat of the climate.</p>

<p>I speak of coffee respectfully. It was not “Java and Mocha
Mixed.” Do you remember how the men carried it on the
march? The detachable lining of the haversack furnished the
bag. The ground coffee and the brown sugar, well mixed, made
a solid ball held in the bottom under a retaining knot tied in the
bag itself. A well-battered tin can served as the pot, and in it
the mixture was boiled until the last percentage of caffeine was
extracted, and the liquid and solid parts were in equal and uniform
mixture. Then came that miracle of simultaneous cooling
and settling and diluting by a little cool water poured on the top.
What a fountain of life we drank from that flowing bowl, soothing
to tired muscles and sore feet.</p>

<p>It is true that our diet had not always the same monotony.
At Wapping Heights, in what the men called the “Molasses Gap,”
in July of 1863, we had marched away from these regular rations,
and our diet was more varied and scanty. The purveyor for my
mess who had charge of my led horse and the incidental purveying
captured a lean old duck. A few fragments of beet leaves
from a trampled garden, and a half handful of cracker dust from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
his inverted haversack, water, the fragments of duck, and no
salt, the whole imperfectly boiled, was offered for our dinner.</p>

<p>It was several years before my stomach would accept duck
again.</p>

<p>Later in the day we had a handful of blueberries. The next
day, returning out of the gap, the brigade nearly went to pieces
in an old blackberry field. Later in the day a lean, wayworn
steer was sacrificed, speedily dissected, and passed around while
still warm to be broiled in the smoke. As Dr. Johnson said of
the beef in the Hebrides, it was “ill-kept, ill-killed, ill-dressed,
ill-cooked, and ill-served.” Too tough for chewing, it could be
cut small and swallowed. In the night, on picket, there was a
shower, by advantage of which some of my men stole a hive of
honey. I ate, in the rage of hunger, I think a couple of pounds,
comb, grubs and all, and then an oppressive doubt struck me
that perhaps beeswax was not digestible. But I slept well,
though wet, after a day in which the fare, scanty but diversified,
was blueberries, blackberries, tough beef, and honey, served in
succession.</p>

<p>But I am rambling. The war ended at Appomattox, in a
climax, both in a military and dietetic sense.</p>

<p>The climax of the diet consisted in the fact that, having run
away from our wagons and the pork and hardtack, for two days
we had nothing, which fact prepared me for an anticlimax.</p>

<p>Some relief came later at Appomattox after the surrender, and
while we were waiting for some final details some of us were
invited to dine with a family living there. To show that we had
no hard feeling we accepted the invitation, and consolidated our
rations. We furnished salt pork and coffee, and the family a
chicken miraculously spared for the occasion. There were also
hot biscuits. There was not enough of the consolidated provisions
to go around in full helpings, but the buckles of our belts
were in the last hole, and, being guests, we restrained our appetites.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
The hot biscuits left a good taste in our mouths. Later I
had a further relief in the commissary line. On the 12th of
April, 1865, we left the Appomattox House, on a not very hurried
march back toward Petersburg. There was now no such occasion
for haste as when we came up, no occasion except for lack of
rations, and lack of rations discourages haste. Our horses were
in the same gaunt condition, and showed no tendency to wild
galloping. It fell to my lot that morning to ride ahead of the
column with a single orderly, and about noon we came upon a
solitary negro shanty in the edge of a wood. In the front (and
only) door stood one of the emancipated.</p>

<p>Feeling sociably inclined at the sight of a human being unexpected
on that road, I accosted her in a friendly way, but omitted
the customary preliminary topic in beginning conversation
with strangers. The weather was not on my mind, nor the surrender,
nor the condition of the country in general, nor of the
colored race in particular. I went directly to the most important
matter in the world at that time, and from my point of view.
Had she anything to eat? Neither the appearance of the house
nor of the woman had any suggestion of Delmonico’s, but that
did not deter me. I was not expecting terrapin stew or roast
beef. Such things had passed out of the memory of my stomach,
though scientific men tell us that the memory of the smells is the
most acute and permanent of all the senses. I doubt if at that
time I should have recognized the smell of roast beef had it been
in the atmosphere. There was a distressing hesitation in the
old woman’s manner, but finally she admitted that she was the
possessor of a hoe cake. A hoe cake! The discovery of America
was a less important event (to the orderly and myself), and the
shout of “Land” no more exciting to the sailors of Columbus
than the announcement of “hoe cake” to the followers of Grant
on that occasion. The woman disappeared for a moment, and
then produced the goods. It was almost within my grasp. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
fear the immediate negotiations were precipitate on my part.
She had a corner in the market. There was no standard of
prices on hoe cake that we knew of, and doubtless the shrewd
old mammy understood the situation and our needs. My
memory is not clear as to the details of the negotiations. In my
eagerness to secure the cake the details are obscured by the
importance of the result. Whether the price was fixed by the
woman, or whether I offered all the money I had, is not now
clear to me. Probably it was the latter. At any rate, the price
agreed upon was a quarter of a dollar, enough, I have since surmised,
to buy, at that time, a whole bushel of corn. By favor
of an overruling Providence, and against all probability, I had
that quarter. It was the extent of my financial assets, and I
was on the verge of liquidation. But what of that? The choice
between starvation and bankruptcy is soon made. In fact it
made itself. The quarter was, of course, of the shinplaster kind,
sole currency in those days. It was depreciated in value, as we
knew to our sorrow, and hoe cake had appreciated. But I paid
over that quarter, the most important property I ever possessed.
I justify this statement to incredulous comrades. What might
have happened in lack of it? It probably saved me from the
crime of highway robbery, of burglary, or even murder, depending
upon the obstinacy and resistance on the part of the newly
emancipated, refusing to surrender the cake without compensation.
But I acquired it honorably, by fair bargain, and at the
seller’s price, although possibly, as it now occurs to me, she may
have been overawed by the presence of superior armed force.
But she did not look it, and I dismiss the unworthy surmise.
She had a monopoly and exercised it with moderation, a shining
though humble example, which, I hope, will make John D., J. P.
Morgan, and the Armours ashamed of themselves when they
read this history; and I am proud on my own part to record
this transaction as a refutation of the groundless charges that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
soldiers, on both sides, during the Civil War, stole chickens and
other edible things.</p>

<p>I fancy that I hear some inquisitive comrade or even a common
civilian, after all this fuss which I have made about a hoe
cake, inquiring how large it was. That question cannot be
answered so easily. Dimensions are relative, and it will not be
expected that I measured it accurately. If I inserted that detail
it would, to an unfriendly critic (and there are such among the
common civilians above mentioned and sometimes among old
soldiers), it would, I say, give an air of improbability to the whole
story. This I desire to avoid, for I have in mind the incredulous
reception of another story, told by some comrade, in which he
represents himself as lying, on a winter’s night, on a blood-soaked
field of battle (apparently the sole survivor), and protecting himself
from the cold, by dead bodies, one on each side and another at
his head; and I do not propose, in this history, to give comrades
or others occasion to quote to me the insinuating remark, “Tell
that to the marines.”</p>

<p>But to recur to the hoe cake, from which I have so widely and
unwarrantedly digressed. As I have said, dimensions are relative.
To me, at that time, it appeared larger than the rising
moon, distorted and enlarged by the evening mists, or, not to
seem too poetic, as large as the fifth wheel of a battery as it
appears stuck on behind.</p>

<p>I do not wish to exaggerate, but only to express adequately
the importance of the ancient corn product on this occasion, and
as it looms up in my memory. To any inquiring mind still
unsatisfied it may be said that subsequent observations, made
under circumstances more favorable to accurate measurement,
lead me to believe that the cake aforesaid was about eight inches
in diameter, and an inch and a half thick.</p>

<p>Still I do not hold to these subsequent observations and reflections.
That hoe cake remains, in the memory of my early life,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
as the rising moon in the east, while I now, alas! am tending low
down in the west.</p>

<p>But there is another and to me still more important circumstance
connected with this affair, affecting my subsequent history
and moral character, and only as a most confidential communication
to my companions of the war do I write it down as a
turning point in my history.</p>

<p>I was never before under such moral strain or under anything
approximating such strain, except once, somewhere about the
region of Spottsylvania, C. H., when, after a prolonged diet of
dirt, salt pork, fried or raw, and hardtack, a brother officer lent
me his canteen just brought up from the rear filled with a rich
soup. I did not drink (as I afterwards feared) all I properly
might; but then he stood before me with a watchful eye. Here I
was in full control of the situation. I am proud to say that even
at that late stage in the war I had such moral sense remaining as
to property and particularly as to hospitality, and I shared with
the orderly, probably as hungry as I. But how did I divide?
Equally, notwithstanding the disparity of rank and the fact of
possession. My good angel must have been with me. Spite of
the clamors of a beastly appetite, and although the cake was
round, I broke it on the square.</p>

<p>Success in that severe trial has rendered it easier, in all these
subsequent years, to divide fairly with my fellow man. Perhaps
I have not always done it, but when it has fallen to my lot to cut
a pie I have remembered that hoe cake.</p>

<p>As to the eating, I did not observe the orderly. I was too busy
with my half. It is safe to assume that he ate his. Of course no
drink offering accompanied the cake. It was sheer grinding and
mastication, but the flavor developed can be understood only by
one who has exercised the process, under like conditions, to wit:
hunger and the hoe cake. It brought out the ethereal sweetness
of the Indian corn, a flavor as of sunshine and mother earth, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
the neighborhood of oak and pine and sassafras and wild flowers,
combined in the subtle chemistry of nature. I Fletcherized
before Fletcher, and looked regretfully on the last fragment. I
learned, too, that important lesson that the pleasure of eating
depends more on the appetite than upon the diet.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
